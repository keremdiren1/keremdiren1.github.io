			<p>An attribute is the private variable of a class.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>A behavior is the method of a class.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Data encapsulation is a technique in which the details of a class are kept hidden. Data like attributes can’t be accessed except by a public method.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The word private and public affect whether a method, attribute etc. can be accessed. Private ones can be accessed only by public stuff like methods.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Instance variables are encapsulated by the private access modifier.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Constructors are used to initialize the state, values etc. of an object. Usually all of the instance variables are initialized by the constructor.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>There are three types of comments. The // can be used to write comments on a line. The /* can be used to write comments until the */ written after it. The /** is just like /* except it is used for documentation.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>A precondition, which is written in comments, is a condition that has to be satisfied before the section is activated.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>A postcondition, which is written in comments, is a condition that has to be satisfied by the execution of the section.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>A getter is a method that returns the value represented by its name. For example, a getName() method would return a String that represents the name of the object.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>A void method does not return a value. A void method’s header contains the word “void” before the method name.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>A setter/mutator method is a method that is used to update values otherwise inaccessible. This method is usually set to type void.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>A non-void method returns a value. The type of the returned value must be in the place of void. For example, if int is written in the place of void, an int value like 1, 2 etc. must be returned by the method.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The return keyword is used to return a value. For example, “return 12” would return the value 12.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>If a variable is returned by a method, the value returned by a primitive method is only the value, not the variable. Unlike this, the value returned by an object will be the reference to it (a String variable would return the reference to it, not the String value itself).</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>When an object itself is printed, its toString method activates. This means that the value returned by the toString method is the value printed on the console. The toString method returns the reference to the object by default. However, it might be overridden by programmer if the person desires.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Scope is a word that means the range of a variable’s accessibility.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>A local variable is a variable which’s scope is where it was declare. For example, if a variable is declared in a method, Anything outside of the method can’t access the variable. Anything inside the method, however, can access the variable (an if statement, for loop etc.).</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>When there is a local variable with the same name as an instance variable, the variable name will refer to the local variable. If the instance variable is needed to be accessed, this keyword can be used. An instance variable named “name” can be accessed by “this.name”.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Formal parameters, just like local variables, can only be accessed from the method it was declared.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>A static method or variable includes the static keyword before its type.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Static variables and methods belong to the class. Static methods can not be accessed from the objects of the class. Static variables, however, can be accessed. Unlike instance variables, every object shares one copy of a static variable. When a static variable is changed by an object, the static variable of another object of the same class will also be changed since they are actually the same variable.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Static variables and methods can be accessed with the name of the class and the dot operator. For example, a static variable named “name” can be accessed with “ClassName.name”.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>A non-static method can access static methods and variables. Static methods, however, can only access other static methods and variables.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Procedural abstraction (creating methods) reduces the complexity of the code. This means that methods help the code to be more abstract, leaving any unnecessary and repetitive code out away from the programmers eyes.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>We can write methods by writing the access modifier (public or private), return type (void, int, String etc.), the name of the method, and the method’s arguments; the static keyword can be written before the return type of the method if the method is a static method. After this, the inside of the method can be written in between “{“ and “}”.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The “this” keyword can be used to refer to the object itself. This keyword can not be written in static methods, however.</p>
