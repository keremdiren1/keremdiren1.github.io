			<p>Recursion is when a method calls itself in its own body. For a recursion method to work, there has to be two things in the recursive method. First is a condition to stop; if there is no condition to stop, the loop would keep calling itself, which wouldn't let the code to progress. The second is the change; since the method calls itself, if there isn't any change (in the input or a variable of the class etc.), the method would never reach its condition to stop, which would also keep it going on with no forever.</p>

	    body {
            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
            background-color: #f4f4f4;
            padding: 20px;
        }
        pre {
            background-color: #e8e8e8;
            padding: 15px;
            border-radius: 5px;
            overflow-x: auto;
        }
    </style>
    <pre><code>
public class Factorial{
	public int factorial(int n){
		if (n == 0){
			return 1;
		}
		return n * factorial(n-1);
	}
	public static void main(String[] args){
		
	}
}
	    </code></pre>
			<p>In this code block, the condition to stop is "if (n == 0){" and the change is "factorial(n-1)". If there was no condition to stop, the method would keep calling "return n * factorial(n-1);", which would go on forever since the method would still continue when n becomes negative, too. If there was no change, the method would also keep going since the method would never reach the condition to stop, which means the method would keep calling "return n * factorial(n);".</p>
